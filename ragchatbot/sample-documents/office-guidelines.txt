================================================================================
SECTION 1 — PURPOSE AND SCOPE
================================================================================

1.1 This document sets out the operational guidelines, workplace policies, and facility usage rules for all employees, contractors, and visitors at TanLaw Advisory Pte Ltd ("the Firm"). It applies to all Firm premises, including the main office at 80 Robinson Road and any temporary or co-working spaces used for Firm activities.

1.2 All employees are expected to comply with these guidelines. Repeated non-compliance may result in a verbal warning (first instance), written warning (second instance), or further disciplinary action in accordance with the Firm's Disciplinary Policy (HR-POL-008).

================================================================================
SECTION 2 — WORKING HOURS AND ATTENDANCE
================================================================================

2.1 Standard Working Hours

The Firm's standard working hours are Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, with a one-hour lunch break (typically taken between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM). The Firm operates on a 44-hour work week in accordance with Singapore's Employment Act.

Employees are expected to be at their workstations and ready to work by the start time. Consistent lateness (arriving more than 15 minutes late more than 3 times in a calendar month without prior arrangement) will be flagged to the employee's supervisor.

2.2 Flexible Working Hours

Employees who have completed their probationary period may request flexible start times between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM, with the corresponding end time adjusted to complete a standard 8-hour workday (excluding the lunch break). For example:

    Start 8:00 AM  →  End 5:00 PM
    Start 8:30 AM  →  End 5:30 PM
    Start 9:00 AM  →  End 6:00 PM (standard)
    Start 9:30 AM  →  End 6:30 PM
    Start 10:00 AM →  End 7:00 PM

Flexible start times must be agreed upon with the employee's direct supervisor and must be consistent (i.e., the same start time each day, not varying day-to-day). Changes to the agreed flexible start time require at least 2 weeks' notice to the supervisor.

Probationary employees must work standard hours (9:00 AM to 6:00 PM) unless an exception is granted by the department head for documented personal circumstances (e.g., childcare arrangements, long commute due to relocation).

2.3 Time Recording

Employees are not currently required to clock in or out. However, the Firm reserves the right to introduce time recording measures if attendance issues arise. Employees on hourly-rate client engagements must record their billable hours daily in the Firm's billing system.

2.4 Overtime

The Firm does not operate a formal overtime policy for salaried employees. Employees are expected to manage their workload within standard working hours. Where client deadlines or urgent matters require extended hours, the Firm recognises this through:

    (a) Time-off-in-lieu (TOIL): Employees who work more than 2 hours beyond their scheduled end time or work on weekends/public holidays may claim TOIL at the discretion of their supervisor. TOIL must be taken within 30 days and does not accumulate.

    (b) Working late meal claims: See the Expense Claims Policy (FIN-POL-003), Section 2.5.

    (c) Late-night transport: Employees who work past 10:00 PM may claim taxi/PHV fare home. See the Expense Claims Policy, Section 2.1(d).

Part-time employees and employees covered by Part IV of the Employment Act (earning up to SGD 2,600 per month) are entitled to overtime pay at 1.5x the hourly basic rate for hours worked beyond the standard 44-hour week, in accordance with the Employment Act.

================================================================================
SECTION 3 — REMOTE WORK POLICY
================================================================================

3.1 Eligibility

Employees who have completed their probationary period may work remotely up to 2 days per week, subject to the following conditions:

    (a) Prior approval from the employee's direct supervisor
    (b) Remote work days are agreed upon in advance and logged in the HR portal by 6:00 PM the preceding Friday
    (c) The employee's role does not require physical presence (e.g., employees who manage physical filing, reception duties, or in-person client appointments may have reduced remote work eligibility)
    (d) The employee has demonstrated the ability to work independently and meet deadlines during the probation period

3.2 Probation Period Exceptions

Probationary employees are generally expected to work from the office full-time to facilitate training, mentoring, and integration. Exceptions may be granted by the department head for:

    (a) Employees whose role is primarily digital and does not require in-person collaboration
    (b) Documented personal circumstances (e.g., medical condition, caregiving responsibilities)
    (c) Office closure due to building maintenance or similar situations

Probationary employees granted remote work exceptions are limited to 1 day per week.

3.3 Remote Work Expectations

Employees working remotely are expected to:

    (a) Be available and responsive on Microsoft Teams during their scheduled working hours
    (b) Attend all scheduled meetings via video call with cameras on (unless bandwidth issues prevent this, in which case the employee should notify participants at the start of the meeting)
    (c) Ensure a stable internet connection (minimum recommended: 25 Mbps download / 10 Mbps upload)
    (d) Work from a quiet, private environment suitable for handling confidential client information — public spaces such as cafes, co-working spaces, and libraries are not permitted for work involving confidential client data
    (e) Respond to Teams messages and emails within 30 minutes during working hours
    (f) Be available for ad-hoc in-office attendance with 24 hours' notice if required for client meetings or urgent matters

3.4 Remote Work from Overseas

Working remotely from overseas is not permitted for periods exceeding 5 consecutive working days without prior approval from the Managing Partner. Tax and regulatory implications may apply for extended overseas remote work. Employees planning to work from overseas must submit a request at least 14 days in advance, specifying:

    (a) The country and city
    (b) The duration
    (c) The reason
    (d) Confirmation that they will have secure internet access and an appropriate working environment
    (e) Acknowledgement that they are responsible for any personal tax obligations arising from the overseas work arrangement

3.5 Revocation

Remote work privileges may be revoked at any time if:

    (a) The employee's performance or responsiveness declines
    (b) Client or project requirements change
    (c) The employee breaches the remote work expectations set out in Section 3.3
    (d) The Firm determines that in-office presence is required for a specific period

Revocation decisions are made by the department head and communicated with at least 5 working days' notice (except for urgent client needs).
