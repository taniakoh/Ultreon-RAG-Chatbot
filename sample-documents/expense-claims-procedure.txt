================================================================================
SECTION 1 — PURPOSE AND SCOPE
================================================================================

1.1 This policy governs the reimbursement of business expenses incurred by employees of TanLaw Advisory Pte Ltd ("the Firm") in the course of their duties. It establishes clear guidelines for claimable expenses, approval workflows, submission requirements, and reimbursement timelines.

1.2 This policy applies to all employees (full-time, part-time, and contract), as well as interns on placements of 3 months or more. Interns on placements shorter than 3 months may claim expenses only with prior written approval from their supervising consultant.

1.3 All employees are expected to exercise sound judgment and frugality when incurring business expenses. The Firm reimburses expenses that are reasonable, necessary, and directly related to business activities. Extravagant or unnecessary expenditure will not be reimbursed, regardless of whether it falls within the category limits set out in this policy.

================================================================================
SECTION 2 — EXPENSE CATEGORIES AND LIMITS
================================================================================

2.1 Transport — Local

    (b) Additional mobile charges (e.g., international roaming during business travel) may be claimed with an itemised phone bill and evidence of the business travel dates.

================================================================================
SECTION 4 — SUBMISSION PROCESS
================================================================================

4.1 Submission Method

All expense claims must be submitted through the Firm's Finance portal (accessible at finance.tanlaw.sg). Paper-based claims are no longer accepted as of 1 January 2025.

4.2 Submission Deadline

Claims must be submitted within 30 calendar days of the expense being incurred. For overseas travel, the 30-day period begins on the day of return to Singapore.

    Claims submitted between 31 and 60 days: May be processed with a written explanation for the delay, approved by the department head.

    Claims submitted after 60 days: Will be rejected. No exceptions. Employees are responsible for submitting claims in a timely manner.

4.3 Supporting Documentation

Each claim must include the following:

    (a) A clear description of the business purpose (not just "client meeting" — specify the client name and topic)
    (b) The date the expense was incurred
    (c) An itemised receipt or invoice. Credit card statements alone are not sufficient except for online subscriptions where an itemised receipt is not available.
    (d) For meals: the names and companies of all attendees
    (e) For transport: the origin, destination, and business purpose
    (f) For overseas expenses: the exchange rate used (see Section 5)

Photographs of receipts are accepted, provided the receipt is fully legible. Employees are encouraged to photograph receipts immediately, as thermal paper receipts fade over time.

4.4 Missing Receipts

If a receipt is lost or was not provided (e.g., taxi without receipt), the employee may submit a statutory declaration of the expense using the Missing Receipt Declaration form on the Finance portal. Missing receipt declarations are limited to SGD 50 per individual claim and SGD 200 per calendar year per employee. Claims above these thresholds without receipts will be rejected.

================================================================================
SECTION 5 — FOREIGN CURRENCY AND EXCHANGE RATES
================================================================================

5.1 Expenses incurred in foreign currencies should be converted to Singapore Dollars at the exchange rate on the date the expense was incurred. Employees should use the exchange rate from XE.com (xe.com/currencyconverter) or their credit card statement as the basis for conversion.

5.2 If the employee obtained foreign currency before the trip, the actual exchange rate paid (as shown on the money changer's receipt or bank statement) may be used instead.

5.3 Exchange rate losses (i.e., the difference between the rate at which currency was obtained and the rate at which it was spent) are borne by the employee and are not claimable.

================================================================================
SECTION 6 — APPROVAL WORKFLOW
================================================================================

6.1 Standard Approval

    Claims under SGD 100:                   Approved by direct supervisor

    Supervisor unavailable:     Routed to department head

7.2 Claims approved on or before the 20th of a month will be included in that month's payroll. Claims approved after the 20th will be included in the following month's payroll.

7.3 For employees who are leaving the Firm (resignation or contract end), all outstanding expense claims must be submitted at least 10 working days before the last day of employment. Claims submitted after the employee's last day will be processed within 30 days via bank transfer to the employee's registered bank account.

================================================================================

8.3 Corporate credit card statements are reviewed monthly by the Finance team. Cardholders must reconcile their statements and submit supporting documentation for all transactions by the 10th of the following month.

8.4 The credit limit on corporate cards is set based on the employee's role:

    Department Head:       SGD 5,000 per month
