Document Reference: OPS-PRO-002
Effective Date: 1 January 2025
Last Revised: 5 December 2024
Approved By: Sarah Tan, Managing Partner
Next Review Date: 1 July 2025

================================================================================
SECTION 1 — PURPOSE AND SCOPE
================================================================================

1.1 This document sets out the standard procedures for onboarding new clients at TanLaw Advisory Pte Ltd ("the Firm"). A consistent onboarding process ensures regulatory compliance, manages risk, sets clear client expectations, and establishes a professional working relationship from the outset.

1.2 These procedures apply to all new client engagements, regardless of the service type, fee structure, or referring source. They also apply to re-onboarding lapsed clients (see Section 9) and engagements referred from partner firms (see Section 10).

1.3 The assigned consultant (the primary person responsible for the client relationship) is accountable for completing all onboarding steps. The assigned consultant may delegate administrative tasks to a junior team member but remains responsible for verification, compliance, and quality.

1.4 No billable work may commence until the onboarding process is complete, including signed engagement letter and cleared KYC checks. Any exception must be approved in writing by the Managing Partner.

================================================================================
SECTION 2 — INITIAL ENGAGEMENT AND RESPONSE TIMELINES
================================================================================

2.1 New Enquiries

When a prospective client makes an enquiry through any channel (phone, email, website contact form, LinkedIn message, walk-in, or referral), the receiving employee must log the enquiry in the Firm's CRM system within 4 business hours.

2.2 Response Timelines

The assigned consultant must respond to the prospective client within the following timeframes:

    Direct referral from existing client:     Within 4 business hours
    Referral from partner firm:               Within 4 business hours
    Website or LinkedIn enquiry:              Within 1 business day
    Walk-in or phone enquiry:                 Same business day (or next business day if received after 4:00 PM)

2.3 Initial Response Content

The initial response should:

    (a) Acknowledge the enquiry and thank the prospective client for their interest;
    (b) Confirm that their enquiry has been assigned to a named consultant;
    (c) Provide a brief (2-3 sentence) overview of the Firm's relevant services;
    (d) Propose a complimentary initial consultation (see Section 3);
    (e) Include the assigned consultant's direct contact details.

2.4 If the enquiry relates to a service area that the Firm does not cover, the assigned consultant should politely decline and, where appropriate, refer the prospective client to a trusted partner firm. All such referrals must be logged in the CRM system.

================================================================================
SECTION 3 — INITIAL CONSULTATION
================================================================================

3.1 Format and Duration

All new prospective clients are offered a complimentary initial consultation of up to 30 minutes. The consultation may be conducted:

    (a) In person at the Firm's office (preferred for corporate clients);
    (b) Via video call (Zoom or Google Meet — links provided by the consultant);
    (c) Via phone call (only if the client specifically requests this).

    (e) Answering the client's questions about the Firm, the team, and the process.

3.3 Consultation Notes

The assigned consultant must record consultation notes in the CRM system within 1 business day of the consultation. Notes should include: attendees, key topics discussed, client requirements, any concerns raised, proposed next steps, and the estimated engagement value.

3.4 Post-Consultation Follow-Up

    (b) Outlines the proposed next steps;
    (c) Lists the KYC documents required (see Section 4);
    (d) Provides an estimated timeline for commencing work (assuming KYC and engagement letter are completed promptly).

If the prospective client does not respond within 7 business days of the follow-up email, the consultant should send a single reminder. If there is no response within a further 14 business days, the enquiry may be marked as "Dormant" in the CRM. Dormant enquiries are reviewed quarterly.

================================================================================
SECTION 7 — FEE STRUCTURES AND PAYMENT TERMS
================================================================================

7.1 Fee Structure Options

The Firm offers the following fee structures:

    (a) Fixed Fee: A predetermined total fee for a defined scope of work. Used for engagements with well-defined deliverables and predictable effort.

    (b) Hourly Rate: Fees based on time spent at the applicable hourly rate. Used for engagements where scope may evolve or is difficult to estimate upfront.

        Standard hourly rates (2025):
            Junior Consultant:      SGD 150 / hour
            Consultant:             SGD 250 / hour
            Senior Consultant:      SGD 350 / hour
            Managing Partner:       SGD 500 / hour

    (c) Retainer: A fixed monthly fee for ongoing advisory services. The retainer covers a specified number of hours per month; excess hours are billed at the applicable hourly rate. Minimum retainer period is 6 months.

    (d) Success Fee: A fee payable upon the successful completion of a defined outcome (e.g., successful resolution of a dispute, completion of a corporate transaction). Success fees must be pre-approved by the Managing Partner and must comply with applicable professional conduct rules.

    (e) Blended / Hybrid: A combination of the above structures (e.g., fixed fee for defined deliverables plus hourly rate for additional work).

7.2 Fee Estimates and Quotations

Before issuing the engagement letter, the assigned consultant must prepare a fee estimate using the Firm's Fee Estimation Worksheet (available on the document portal). The estimate should account for:

    (a) Estimated hours by team member seniority
    (b) Complexity factors (e.g., multi-jurisdictional issues, tight timelines, large volume of documents)
    (c) Out-of-pocket disbursements (filing fees, search fees, courier charges, etc.)
    (d) A contingency buffer of 10-15% for unforeseen complexity

7.3 Fee estimates must be reviewed by the department head before being communicated to the client. For engagements with estimated fees exceeding SGD 20,000, the Managing Partner must also approve the estimate.

7.4 Disbursements

Out-of-pocket disbursements (e.g., government filing fees, search fees, courier charges, notarisation fees) are charged to the client at cost, without markup. Disbursements are itemised separately on invoices. The Firm may request an advance disbursement deposit for engagements expected to incur significant third-party costs.

7.5 Payment Terms

    Standard payment terms:     50% upon signing the engagement letter, 50% upon completion
    Retainer engagements:       Paid monthly in advance by the 5th of each month
    Hourly rate engagements:    Invoiced monthly in arrears, payable within 14 days of invoice date
    Disbursements:              Invoiced monthly with the regular fee invoice

7.6 Overdue Payments

Invoices not paid within 30 days of the due date will incur a late payment charge of 1.5% per month on the outstanding balance. The Firm reserves the right to suspend work on the engagement if payment is overdue by more than 60 days, after providing 14 days' written notice to the client.

================================================================================
SECTION 8 — CONFLICT OF INTEREST CHECK
================================================================================

8.1 Before accepting any new client or engagement, the assigned consultant must conduct a conflict of interest check by searching the Firm's CRM and client database for:

    (a) Existing or past relationships with the prospective client;
    (b) Existing or past relationships with any adverse party identified by the prospective client;
    (c) Any personal relationships between Firm employees and the prospective client or adverse parties.

8.2 The conflict check must be documented in the CRM system using the Conflict Check Form. The form must be completed and reviewed before the engagement letter is issued.

8.3 If a potential conflict is identified, the matter must be escalated to the Managing Partner for a decision. The Managing Partner may:

    (a) Determine that no actual conflict exists and approve the engagement;
    (b) Determine that a conflict exists but can be managed with appropriate safeguards (e.g., information barriers, separate teams), and approve the engagement with conditions;
    (c) Decline the engagement.

8.4 If a conflict is discovered after the engagement has commenced, the assigned consultant must notify the Managing Partner immediately. The Managing Partner will determine the appropriate course of action, which may include withdrawing from the engagement.

================================================================================
SECTION 9 — RE-ONBOARDING LAPSED CLIENTS
================================================================================

9.1 A client is considered "lapsed" if there has been no active engagement for 24 months or more.

9.2 Lapsed clients who wish to re-engage the Firm must undergo a refreshed onboarding process, including:

    (a) Updated KYC documentation (identification documents may be re-used if still valid and unchanged; proof of address and ACRA BizFile must be refreshed)
    (b) A new sanctions screening (Section 5)
    (c) A new conflict of interest check (Section 8)
    (d) A new engagement letter for the specific scope of work

9.3 The previous client file in the DMS will be archived and a new file created for the refreshed engagement. The archived file remains accessible for reference but is read-only.

================================================================================
SECTION 10 — REFERRALS FROM PARTNER FIRMS
================================================================================

10.1 When a client is referred from a partner firm (e.g., an accounting firm, a foreign law firm, or a financial adviser), the standard onboarding process applies in full. A referral does not exempt the client from KYC or AML screening.
