Document Reference: HR-POL-001
Effective Date: 1 January 2025
Last Revised: 15 November 2024
Approved By: Sarah Tan, Managing Partner
Next Review Date: 1 January 2026

================================================================================
SECTION 1 — PURPOSE AND SCOPE
================================================================================

1.1 This policy sets out the leave entitlements, application procedures, and absence management guidelines for all employees of TanLaw Advisory Pte Ltd ("the Firm"). It applies to full-time employees, part-time employees, contract employees, and interns, unless otherwise stated.

1.2 This policy is designed to comply with the Employment Act 1968 (Singapore), the Child Development Co-Savings Act, and the Enlistment Act, as amended from time to time. Where this policy provides benefits that exceed statutory minimums, the Firm's provisions shall apply. Where any provision of this policy falls below the statutory minimum, the statutory minimum shall prevail.

1.3 The Firm recognises that regular time off is essential for employee wellbeing and sustained productivity. All employees are strongly encouraged to utilise their full leave entitlement each calendar year.

================================================================================
SECTION 2 — ANNUAL LEAVE ENTITLEMENT
================================================================================

2.1 Standard Entitlement

Full-time employees are entitled to paid annual leave based on their completed years of continuous service with the Firm:

    Year 1:     14 days
    Year 2:     14 days
    Year 3:     16 days
    Year 4:     16 days
    Year 5:     18 days
    Year 6:     18 days
    Year 7:     20 days
    Year 8+:    20 days (capped)

For the avoidance of doubt, "Year 1" refers to the first 12 months of continuous employment from the employee's start date. Leave entitlement for each subsequent year is credited on the anniversary of the employee's start date, not on 1 January.

2.2 Part-Time Employee Entitlement

Part-time employees receive annual leave on a pro-rata basis, calculated as follows:

    Pro-rata leave = (Contracted hours per week / 44) x Full-time entitlement

For example, a part-time employee contracted for 22 hours per week in their first year of service would receive: (22/44) x 14 = 7 days of annual leave.

Part-time employees who work irregular hours shall have their entitlement calculated based on the average weekly hours worked over the preceding 3-month period.

2.3 Contract Employees

Employees on fixed-term contracts of 6 months or more receive the same leave entitlement as full-time employees, pro-rated to the contract duration. Employees on contracts shorter than 6 months are not entitled to paid annual leave but may request unpaid leave at the discretion of their supervisor.

2.4 Interns

Interns on placements of 3 months or more are entitled to 1 day of paid leave per month of service, up to a maximum of 3 days. Interns on placements shorter than 3 months are not entitled to paid leave but may request unpaid absence with supervisor approval.

2.5 Probationary Employees

Employees on probation accrue leave from their start date at the standard rate. However, probationary employees may not take annual leave during the first 3 months of employment unless one of the following exceptional circumstances applies:

    (a) A pre-arranged commitment disclosed at the time of accepting the offer of employment and confirmed in writing by the HR department before the start date;
    (b) A medical emergency affecting the employee or an immediate family member (spouse, child, parent, or sibling);
    (c) A bereavement covered under Section 8 (Compassionate Leave) of this policy.

Any leave taken during the probation period under exceptions (b) or (c) must be supported by documentation (medical certificate or death certificate) submitted within 48 hours. Leave taken under exception (a) will be deducted from the employee's annual entitlement.

After the first 3 months of probation, employees may take annual leave subject to the standard application process in Section 3, even if the probation period has not yet concluded.

================================================================================
SECTION 3 — LEAVE APPLICATION PROCESS
================================================================================

3.1 Advance Notice Requirements

All leave requests must be submitted through the Firm's HR portal (accessible at hr.tanlaw.sg) in accordance with the following minimum notice periods:

    Leave of 1-3 days:          7 working days' notice
    Leave of 4-7 days:          14 working days' notice
    Leave of 8 days or more:    21 working days' notice

Requests that do not meet the minimum notice period may be rejected. In exceptional circumstances, late requests may be approved at the discretion of the employee's direct supervisor, provided that client commitments and team coverage are not adversely affected.

3.2 Approval Authority

    Leave of 1-5 days:          Approved by direct supervisor
    Leave of 6-10 days:         Approved by department head
    Leave exceeding 10 days:    Approved by the Managing Partner

3.3 Peak Period Restrictions

The Firm designates the following as peak periods during which leave is restricted and requires additional approval from the Managing Partner, regardless of the duration:

    (a) 15 December to 5 January (year-end / New Year period)
    (b) The 5 working days immediately preceding and following Chinese New Year
    (c) The last 5 working days of each financial quarter (March, June, September, December)
    (d) Any period designated as a peak period by the Managing Partner with at least 30 days' notice

During peak periods, no more than 2 employees from the same department may be on leave simultaneously. Leave requests for peak periods must be submitted at least 30 working days in advance. Where multiple employees request leave for the same peak period, priority will be given in the following order: (1) employees who did not take leave during the same peak period in the previous year; (2) employees with longer tenure; (3) order of submission.

3.4 Leave Cancellation

Employees who wish to cancel approved leave must notify their supervisor via the HR portal at least 3 working days before the leave start date. Leave cancelled with less than 3 working days' notice will still be deducted from the employee's entitlement unless the cancellation is due to a documented medical emergency or bereavement.

3.5 Unauthorised Absence

Any absence without an approved leave application or valid medical certificate will be treated as unauthorised absence. Unauthorised absence will result in a deduction of pay for the days absent and may lead to disciplinary action. Three or more instances of unauthorised absence within a 12-month period will trigger a formal performance review.

================================================================================
SECTION 4 — CARRY-OVER AND ENCASHMENT
================================================================================

4.1 Carry-Over

Employees may carry over a maximum of 5 unused annual leave days into the following calendar year. Carried-over leave must be utilised by 31 March of the new year. Any carried-over leave not used by 31 March will be forfeited without compensation.

4.2 Encashment

Annual leave is generally not encashable. Encashment of unused leave may only occur in the following circumstances:

    (a) Upon termination of employment (resignation or dismissal), unused accrued leave for the current year will be pro-rated and paid out at the employee's basic daily rate of pay;
    (b) Upon retirement, up to 10 days of unused leave may be encashed;
    (c) In exceptional cases approved in writing by the Managing Partner, up to 3 days of unused leave may be encashed at year-end, subject to a company-wide cap determined annually.

4.3 Leave Forfeiture

In addition to the carry-over forfeiture described in Section 4.1, annual leave will be forfeited in the following circumstances:

    (a) The employee is dismissed for gross misconduct;
    (b) The employee fails to serve the required notice period upon resignation without the Firm's written consent.

================================================================================
SECTION 5 — MEDICAL AND SICK LEAVE
================================================================================

5.1 Entitlement

In accordance with the Employment Act, all employees who have served for at least 3 months are entitled to:

    Paid outpatient sick leave:      14 days per calendar year
    Paid hospitalisation leave:      60 days per calendar year (inclusive of the 14 outpatient days)

Employees who have served for less than 3 months are entitled to a pro-rated amount:

    Month 1:    5 days outpatient / 15 days hospitalisation
    Month 2:    8 days outpatient / 30 days hospitalisation
    Month 3+:   Full entitlement as above

5.2 Medical Certificate Requirements

All sick leave claims must be supported by a medical certificate (MC) issued by a registered medical practitioner. The Firm accepts MCs from:

    (a) Any Singapore-registered medical practitioner (GP or specialist);
    (b) Government hospitals and polyclinics;
    (c) The Firm's designated panel clinics (list available on the HR portal).

MCs from overseas medical practitioners are accepted only if the employee was travelling for work or on approved leave at the time, and the MC is translated into English if issued in another language.

5.3 Submission Deadlines

Medical certificates must be submitted to the HR department within the following timeframes:

    Absence of 1-2 days:           Within 48 hours of returning to work
    Absence of 3 or more days:     Within 48 hours of the first day of absence
    Hospitalisation:                Within 72 hours of admission (or as soon as practicable)

Failure to submit a valid MC within the required timeframe will result in the absence being treated as unauthorised absence under Section 3.5.

5.4 Extended Medical Leave

If an employee's medical leave is expected to exceed 14 continuous days, the employee or their next-of-kin must notify the HR department and the employee's direct supervisor as soon as practicable. The Firm may request additional medical documentation or an independent medical assessment to support extended medical leave beyond 30 continuous days.

================================================================================
SECTION 6 — SPECIAL LEAVE TYPES
================================================================================

6.1 Marriage Leave

All confirmed employees (i.e., past probation) are entitled to 3 days of paid marriage leave for their first legal marriage. This leave must be taken within 3 months of the date of marriage and is supported by submission of the marriage certificate. Marriage leave is a one-time entitlement per employee, regardless of subsequent marriages.

6.2 Childcare Leave

In accordance with the Child Development Co-Savings Act:

    (a) Employees with Singaporean children aged below 7 are entitled to 6 days of paid childcare leave per year (per parent), of which the Firm pays the first 3 days and the Government reimburses the remaining 3 days (capped at $500 per day).
    (b) Employees with Singaporean children aged 7-12 are entitled to 2 days of paid extended childcare leave per year (per parent).
    (c) Childcare leave entitlement applies per parent, not per child. An employee with 3 children under 7 still receives 6 days (not 18).

Employees must provide the child's birth certificate and proof of Singapore citizenship upon first application.

6.3 Paternity Leave

Eligible male employees are entitled to 2 weeks (10 working days) of Government-Paid Paternity Leave (GPPL) for each qualifying birth, subject to the following conditions:

    (a) The child is a Singapore citizen at birth (or becomes one within 12 months);
    (b) The employee has been employed for at least 3 continuous months before the birth;
    (c) Paternity leave must be taken within 16 weeks of the child's birth.

Paternity leave may be taken as a continuous 2-week block or flexibly as individual days, subject to mutual agreement with the supervisor.

6.4 Maternity Leave

Eligible female employees are entitled to 16 weeks of maternity leave in accordance with the Child Development Co-Savings Act. The first 8 weeks are employer-paid; the remaining 8 weeks are Government-paid (subject to a cap). Detailed maternity leave provisions are set out in the Firm's Maternity Leave Policy (HR-POL-001A), available on the HR portal.

6.5 National Service (NS) Leave

Employees who are called up for National Service obligations (In-Camp Training or other NS activities) are entitled to paid NS leave for the duration of the call-up. Employees must submit a copy of the NS call-up notification to the HR department at least 14 days before the commencement of the NS period. The Firm will apply for Government reimbursement of NS make-up pay where applicable. NS leave does not count against the employee's annual leave entitlement.

6.6 Examination Leave

Employees pursuing approved professional qualifications (e.g., Bar examinations, CPA examinations, or other qualifications approved by the department head) are entitled to up to 5 days of paid examination leave per calendar year. This covers the day(s) of examination and one study day immediately preceding each examination paper. Approval requires submission of the examination timetable at least 14 days in advance. Examination leave is not applicable for personal interest courses or qualifications unrelated to the employee's role.

6.7 Unpaid Leave

Unpaid leave may be granted at the discretion of the department head (for requests up to 5 days) or the Managing Partner (for requests exceeding 5 days). Unpaid leave is generally only approved when the employee has exhausted all available paid leave entitlements. During unpaid leave:

    (a) The employee's salary will be deducted on a pro-rata basis;
    (b) CPF contributions will be adjusted accordingly;
    (c) Medical and insurance benefits remain in force for unpaid leave of up to 30 days;
    (d) For unpaid leave exceeding 30 days, the employee must make arrangements with HR regarding the continuation of benefits.

Extended unpaid leave of more than 60 continuous days may affect the employee's annual leave accrual rate and service anniversary calculations.
